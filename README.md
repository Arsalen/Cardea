# Cardea

A blockchain based application that places the patient at the center of the healthcare ecosystem by improving the security, privacy and interoperability of patient data. 

Cardea aims to provide a new model for data exchange by making electronic medical records more efficient, disintermediated and secure, replacing the traditional model of a fragmented, dispersed and stored medical record in a variety of formats.

Furthermore Cardea offers the possibility of creating a reliable, and robust information sharing space between its various actors (Clinics, doctors, Laboratories, patients ...) without being wary of security-related flaws, and to have a consolidated vision of the true medical history.
