# ZXing <small>_in TypeScript_</small> 

> Multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library.
>
> *Ported from [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) project (written in Java).*


## _WIP_

There's still some things we gotta do here, see [Status and Roadmap](#status-and-roadmap) for what is currently done and what's planned next. 

# Demo

See [some demo examples](https://aleris.github.io/zxing-typescript/) in browser.

# Usage

The library can be used from browser with TypeScript (include anything from src/browser however you must do the packaging yourself) or with plain javascript (see below). It can also be used from node (see also below). The library is using separate builds for node and browser to allow different ES targeting.

## Browser Usage

Examples below are for QR barcode, all other supported barcodes work similary.

`npm i @barn/zxing --save`

To use from JS you need to include what you need from `build/umd` folder (for example `zxing.min.js`).

See [some demo examples](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples) for browser code examples with javascript.

All the examples are using ES6, be sure is supported in your browser or modify as needed (eg. var instead of const etc.). 

The browser library is using the [MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) web api which is marked as experimental as of this writing. You can use external polyfills like [webrtc-adapter](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter) to increase browser compatiblity.

Also, note that the library is using the [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) (Int32Array, Uint8ClampedArray, etc.) which are not available in older browsers (for example Android 4 default browser, etc.). You can use a polyfill library like [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) to support these browsers.

### Scanning from Video Camera

To display the input from the video camera you will need to add a video element in the html page:

```html
<video id="video" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid gray"></video>
```

To start decoding, first obtain a list of video input devices with:

```javascript
const codeReader = new ZXing.BrowserQRCodeReader();

codeReader.getVideoInputDevices()
    .then((videoInputDevices) => {
        videoInputDevices.forEach((element) => {
            console.log(`${element.label}, ${element.deviceId}`);          
        });
    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

If there is just one input device you can use the first deviceId and the video element id (in the example below is also 'video') to decode:

```javascript
const firstDeviceId = videoInputDevices[0].deviceId;

codeReader.decodeFromInputVideoDevice(firstDeviceId, 'video')
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

If there are more input devices then you will need to chose one for `codeReader.decodeFromInputVideoDevice` device id parameter.

You can also provide `undefined` for the device id parameter in which case the library will automatically choose the camera, prefering the main (environment facing) camera if more are available:

```javascript
codeReader.decodeFromInputVideoDevice(undefined, 'video')
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

A full working example for [QR Code from Video Camera](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/qr-camera/) is provided in the [examples](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/).

### Scanning from Video File
Similar as above you can use a video element in the html page:

```html
<video id="video" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid gray"></video>
```

And to decode the video from an url:

```javascript
const codeReader = new ZXing.BrowserQRCodeReader();
const videoSrc = 'your url to a video';

codeReader.decodeFromVideoSource(videoSrc, 'video')
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

You can also decode the video url without showing it in the page, in this case no `video` element is needed in html.

```javascript
codeReader.decodeFromVideoSource(videoSrc)
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

A full working example for [QR Code from Video File](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/qr-video/) is provided in the [examples](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/).


### Scanning from Image
Similar as above you can use a img element in the html page (with src attribute set):

```html
<img id="img" src="qrcode-image.png" width="200" height="300" style="border: 1px solid gray"></img>
```

And to decode the image:

```javascript
const codeReader = new ZXing.BrowserQRCodeReader();
const img = document.getElementById('img');

codeReader.decodeFromImage(img)
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

You can also decode the image url without showing it in the page, in this case no `img` element is needed in html:

```javascript
const imgSrc = 'url to image';

codeReader.decodeFromImage(undefined, imgSrc)
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

Or decode the image url directly from an url, with an `img` element in page (notice no `src` attribute is set for `img` element):

```html
<img id="img" width="200" height="300" style="border: 1px solid gray"></img>
```

```javascript
const imgSrc = 'url to image';

codeReader.decodeFromImage('img', imgSrc); // here img is the image id from html, in our case 'img'
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result.text);
    }).catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

A full working example for [QR Code from Image](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/qr-image/) is provided in the [examples](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/).

### Barcode generation

To generate a QR Code SVG image include 'zxing.qrcodewriter.min.js' from `build/vanillajs`. You will need to include an element where the SVG element will be appended:

```html
<div id="result"></div>
```

And then:

```javascript
const codeWriter = new ZXing.BrowserQRCodeSvgWriter('result');
var svgElement = codeWriter.write(input, 300, 300);
```

A full working example for [QR Code write to SVG](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/qr-svg-writer/) is provided in the [examples](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/docs/examples/).

## Using from TypeScript

Install the package:

`npm i @barn/zxing --save`

And then include directly the classes files you need, for example:

```javascript
import { BrowserQRCodeReader, VideoInputDevice } from '@barn/zxing';
```

The usage is identical with the above.

## Node Usage

`npm i @barn/zxing --save`

To use in node you will need to provide an implementation of [`LuminanceSource`](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/blob/master/src/core/LuminanceSource.ts) for an image. A starting point is [`SharpImageLuminanceSource`](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/blob/master/src/test/core/SharpImageLuminanceSource.ts) from tests that is using [sharp image processing](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) node library.

No examples are availabe for now, however you can have a look at the extensive [tests cases](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/tree/master/src/test/core/qrcode).

# Text Encoding and Decoding

To decode a barcode, the library needs at some point to decode from bits to text. Also, to generate a barcode it needs to encode text to bits. Unfortunately, the state of encoding and decoding text in javascript/browser is somehow messy at the moment. 

To have full support for all encodings in [CharacterSetECI](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/blob/master/src/core/common/CharacterSetECI.ts) *except Cp437* use [text-encoding](https://github.com/inexorabletash/text-encoding) library. The library is used implicitly for node (and tests), but is an optional dependency for browser because is rather large (> 600k). You will need to include it yourself if you want/need to use it.

By default, in browser, [TextDecoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder)/[TextEncoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/ro/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder) web api are used if available (take care as these are labeled as experimental as of this writing). Also, be aware that TextEncoder encodes only to UTF-8 as per spec. If these are not available the library falls back to a minimal implementation that only encodes and decodes to/from UTF-8 (see [`StringEncoding`](https://github.com/odahcam/zxing-ts/blob/master/src/core/util/StringEncoding.ts)).
