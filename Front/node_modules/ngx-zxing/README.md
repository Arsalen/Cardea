# ngx-zxing

> Angular QR-Code scanner component.

## Features & Hints

- Supports continuous scanning.
- There is a delay of 1500ms after each successful scan, before a new QR-Code can be detected.
- Supports iOS 11 (only in Safari via HTTPS).
- Nice devs behind it. ðŸ¤“

## Installation

To install this package, run:

```bash
yarn add @zxing/ngx-scanner@latest
```

Then import it into your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
// Common imports
import { NgModule /* , ... */ } from '@angular/core';

// Import the package's module
import { NgxZxingModule } from 'ngx-zxing';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [ /* AppComponent ... */ ],
    imports: [
    
        // BrowserModule, 
        // ...
        
        // ZXing scanner module
        NgxZxingModule.forRoot(),
        
        // another imports...
    ],
    // ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

## Usage

Once the package is imported, you can use it in your Angular application:

```html
<ngx-zxing
    [start]="camStarted"
    [device]="selectedDevice"
    [cssClass]="'small-video'"
    (camerasFound)="displayCameras($event)"
    (scanSuccess)="handleQrCodeResult($event)"
></ngx-zxing>
```

- `start` can be used to start and stop the scanning (defaults to `false`)
- `device` is the video-device used for scanning (use one of the devices emitted by `onCamsFound`)
- `cssClass` this CSS-class name will be appended to the video-element e.g. for resizing it (see below)
- `camerasFound` will emit an array of video-devices after view was initialized
- `scanSuccess` will emit the result as string, after a valid QR-Code was scanned

### Change the size of the preview-element

In your CSS, define an extra class and pass it to the component with the `cssClass`-parameter. CSS might look like this:

```css
.small-video {
    max-height: 70vh;
    width: 100vw;
    object-fit: contain;
}
```

## API

| Method              | Parameters                                     | Returns                          | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **changeDevice**    | `device: MediaDeviceInfo`                      | `void`                           | Allows you to properly change the scanner device on the fly. |
| **camerasFound**    | `callback: (devices: MediaDeviceInfo[]`) => {} | `EventEmitter<MediaDeviceInfo >` | Emits an event when cameras are found.                       |
| **camerasNotFound** | `callback: (): void => {}`                     | `EventEmitter<void>`             | Emits an event when cameras are not found.                   |
| **scanSuccess**     | `callback: (result: string): void => {}`       | `EventEmitter<string>`           | Emits an event when a scan is successful performed.          |
| **scanFailure**     | `callback: (): void => {}`                     | `EventEmitter<void>`             | Emits an event when a scan fails.                            |
| **scanError**       | `callback: (error: any): void => {}`           | `EventEmitter<any>`              | Emits an event when a scan throws an error.                  |

## Performance

Copied from [Instascan](https://github.com/schmich/instascan) by Chris Schmich:

Many factors affect how quickly and reliably ZXing can detect QR codes.

If you control creation of the QR code, consider the following:

- A larger physical code is better. A 2" square code is better than a 1" square code.
- Flat, smooth, matte surfaces are better than curved, rough, glossy surfaces.
- Include a sufficient quiet zone, the white border surrounding QR code. The quiet zone should be at least four times the width of an individual element in your QR code.
- A simpler code is better. You can use [this QR code generator](https://werthdavid.github.io/ngx-kjua/index.html) to see how your input affects complexity.
- For the same length, numeric content is simpler than ASCII content, which is simpler than Unicode content.
- Shorter content is simpler. If you're encoding a URL, consider using a shortener such as [goo.gl](https://goo.gl/) or [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/).

When scanning, consider the following:

- QR code orientation doesn't matter.
- Higher resolution video is better, but is more CPU intensive.
- Direct, orthogonal scanning is better than scanning at an angle.
- Blurry video greatly reduces scanner performance.
- Auto-focus can cause lags in detection as the camera adjusts focus. Consider disabling it or using a fixed-focus camera with the subject positioned at the focal point.
- Exposure adjustment on cameras can cause lags in detection. Consider disabling it or having a fixed white backdrop.

## Limitations

 - The component relies on [zxing-typescript](https://github.com/zxing-web/library) which currently supports only QR-codes and no 1D-Barcode formats
